##Overview

Administrators can access the Custom Reporting tab from the Plan & Usage section in Datadog, then navigate to: 
`Plan & Usage`--> `Custom Reporting`.

This tool enables organizations to split their Datadog usage by up to 3 chosen tag keys and generates daily and monthly usage reports.

The Custom Reporting page provides the following information and functionality:

* It lists the existing tag keys that usage is being broken down by and provides the ability to change and add new ones (up to 3 tag keys).
* It generates daily .tsv (tab separated values) files for most usage types.
* It concatenates daily .tsv files at the end of each month and makes it available for download.

###Getting Started

In order to start receiving daily data, an administrator will need to create a new report via the user interface.
